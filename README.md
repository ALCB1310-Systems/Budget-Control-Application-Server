In this section you will be able to find all of the coding standards that will govern this project, like how to name the variables, how to create functions, write strings, etc

[More...](./Documentation/coding-standards.md)

- ### [Testing](./Documentation/testing.md)

In this section you will be able to find how will all the tests should be written. Since we are going to be developing using TDD this will be the backbone of all the development process.

## Database

### Selecting a RDBMS

In this project we will be using a Relational Database Managment System that will have to have the following characteristics:

- Free to use
- Easy to deploy
- Open source

Given this the main RDBMS available are the following:

- [![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-316192?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-005C84?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)](https://www.mysql.com)
- [![MariaDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MariaDB-003545?style=for-the-badge&logo=mariadb&logoColor=white)](https://mariadb.org)
- [![SQLite](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQLite-07405E?style=for-the-badge&logo=sqlite&logoColor=white)](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- [![Firebird](https://img.shields.io/badge/firebase-ffca28?style=for-the-badge&logo=firebase&logoColor=black)](https://firebirdsql.org)

There are others too, but the ones listed are the major free open source database management systems.

After doing some research it was decided we will be working with PostgreSQL.  This RDBMS is common to find in many sites where we can deploy the app like [Railways](https://railway.app/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or many others that are available.
